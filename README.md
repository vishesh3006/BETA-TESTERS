# Blockchain : Pharmaceutical SupplyChain
## This project showcases the journey of Medicine on blockchain.

The Pharmaceutical supply chain is the sequence of activities and process to bring raw drugs and matrials from supplier(farms) to processed medicine in Pharm.

## Problems in Exixting System
 1 Shipment visibility<br />
 2 Expiration<br />
 3 Slow Process and Error prone paper work<br />
 4 Mutable and Invalid source<br />
 5 Lack of coordination<br />
 6 What we are providing<br />
 7 Accurate information across the entire chain at any point and at any location<br />
 8 Instant access to real-time updates and alerts if issues are detected<br />
 9 Visibility of all handovers in the supply chain<br />
 10 Traceability back to source of all materials<br />
 11 Seamless collaboration between all parties<br />
 12 Reduce paper work and Speedup process<br />
 13 Application Workflow Diagram<br />
